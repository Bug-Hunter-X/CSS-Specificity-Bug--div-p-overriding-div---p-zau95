This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in CSS specificity. The `div > p` selector, which should have higher specificity than `div p`, unexpectedly gets overridden. This is likely due to the browser's handling of complex CSS rules or the presence of other rules in the stylesheet.  The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a possible solution using more specific selectors or other techniques.
