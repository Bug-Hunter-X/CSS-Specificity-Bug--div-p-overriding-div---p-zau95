Several approaches can solve this specificity issue:

1. **Increase Specificity:** Make the `div > p` selector even more specific by adding additional selectors, for example: `div.container > p`.

2. **Use !important (Not Recommended):** Use the `!important` flag, but this is generally considered bad practice and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

3. **Order Matters:** Ensure the `div > p` rule appears *after* the `div p` rule in the stylesheet. However, relying on order is not a clean solution.

4. **ID Selectors:**  Use an ID selector, which has the highest specificity.

The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates a solution using more specific class selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

div > p {
  color: red;
}

div.container > p {
  color: red; /*This is more specific*/
}
```

Choose the solution that best fits your project's structure and coding style.
