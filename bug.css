The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  Notice how the `div p` selector seems to override the more specific `div > p` selector, even though `div > p` should have higher specificity due to its child combinator.

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

div > p {
  color: red;
}
```

This unexpected behavior might arise due to the presence of other CSS rules or due to how the browser handles specificity in complex scenarios involving many selectors.
